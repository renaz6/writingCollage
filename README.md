# writingCollage

This is a very simple coding project I completed for experimental purposes. It takes input from two different text files and returns a "poem" created by randomized 
words and lines from the original two files. 
It was inspired by the "Cut-Up Paper Technique" of song writing, which as often utilized by artist David Bowie.
